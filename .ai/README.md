# `.ai/` — shared AI-agent context (Laravel Boost compatible)

| Path | Purpose | Read by |
|---|---|---|
| `guidelines/*.md` | Concise project rules in **Laravel Boost custom-guideline format**. Boost merges them into `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` (and other agents' files) when `php artisan boost:install` / `boost:update` runs. | Laravel Boost, any agent (plain Markdown) |
| `handoff.md` | Running work log so one agent can continue where another stopped (limits, crashes, context loss). Newest entry first. | Every agent — read at start, update before stopping |

The canonical, detailed project guide is `/AGENTS.md`; `/CLAUDE.md` imports it. Keep facts in sync: when a convention changes, update `AGENTS.md` **and** the matching guideline here.

## Laravel Boost status

Laravel Boost (`laravel/boost`) is **not installed yet**. The project runs **Laravel 13.39 on PHP 8.5**, so Boost 2.x (Laravel ^11.45.3 | ^12.41.1 | ^13) can be installed directly. Only do this when the user asks (it changes `composer.json`/`composer.lock`):

```bash
composer require laravel/boost:^2.0 --dev
php artisan boost:install                      # pick agents: Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, …
php artisan test                               # must stay all green
```

What `boost:install` does with this folder:
- Reads every file in `.ai/guidelines/` and injects it (inside a `<laravel-boost-guidelines>` block) into the agent files it manages, e.g. `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`. Hand-written content outside that block is preserved — after installing, remove duplicated text if the files become too long.
- Writes `boost.json` and MCP config (e.g. `.mcp.json`) that start `php artisan boost:mcp` (tools: app info, DB schema/queries, routes, logs, Tinker, docs search). Re-run `php artisan boost:update` after editing guidelines.
- Boost also offers `/upgrade-laravel-v13`-style guided prompts; the Laravel 12 → 13 upgrade is already done (AGENTS.md §12a).

Safety when Boost's MCP is active: its database tools use the app's `.env` connection. Locally that should be the Docker MariaDB (127.0.0.1:3308) — never point `.env` at the production database. Read-only queries only.
